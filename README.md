- **Marketplace**: Sell or buy items within your local area, making it easier to find what you need and declutter your home.
- **Reminders**: Get timely reminders for important tasks such as garbage collection days.
- **Neighborhood Map**: View your neighbors and find out who is living near you, fostering a sense of community.

## Technology Stack

- **Next.js**: A powerful React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for designing modern and responsive web interfaces.
